      <description>My brain likes to optimize things. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty good at it, unfortunately.
As a result, I spend a lot of time attempting to optimize my life. But you can only do so much. You can eat well, exercise, get proper rest, the list goes on. The struggle of existence is that it&amp;rsquo;s in flux at all times. One cannot effectively program their life, and expect it to stay that way forever.</description>

      <description>Distractions are everywhere. As the years roll on, more and more effective distractions are created. They seem to be so wide reaching that being distracted is now considered a norm. Even hearing that someone is actively doing nothing is considered abnormal now. Boredom is often considered painful (not that it can&amp;rsquo;t be). But what seems to be a worse fate is doom scrolling and still bored. I see it all the time in myself and those around me.</description>

      <title>an argument for old hardware</title>

      <description>Throughout a lot of this writing, you can substitute old for “bad”. I use quotation marks around “bad” because hardware isn’t inherently bad or anything. It simply is often times slower relative to newer hardware. Knowing this, I offer this forewarning: In pursuit of acquiring better programming skills, don’t downgrade if avoidable. The idea of spending money to get older hardware I feel is a situational circumstance most often rewarded by specific projects, not everyday ones.</description>

      <description>How much of life do you actually remember? Which of these things do you remember? It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting concept that these memories are self history hosted within our own brains. Often they&amp;rsquo;re just not immediately accessible. If you think hard enough, what was it like when you were 3? How did you feel when you went to the first day of kindergarten? It&amp;rsquo;s all there, sometimes it just takes more time to retrieve.</description>

      <description>Imagine for a moment if you will, a developer who can work at any desk, with any computer, with any editor. What would that actually look like? How much time would it take for you to master each and every editor, how about operating systems? I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this question a lot the last few days. As I transition into a chapter of my life where portability is becoming more of a factor, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking these questions.</description>

      <description>Throughout the last few weeks and months I’ve taken into great consideration what I actually need. Both personal and professionally, it seems like I’ve sort of had a decent layer of excess build up. By my own metrics I think I’m actually most the way “there” if you will. The last major step for me is moving from desktop to laptop. Regardless, I’m writing this to sort of set some of my personal preferences/metrics in stone for reading.</description>

      <title>quest across the US</title>

      <description>Hey
In the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been sort of entranced with the idea of road-tripping across the US from one coast to the next. It&amp;rsquo;s even on my bucket list. Another part of this trip is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on film &amp;amp; keeping up with making a documentary throughout the whole process of making my game Lost Souls. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing my best to document what I can with what I have.</description>

      <description>Hey! Since the 0.01 Release of Astera I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on making the code more reliable and efficient. I&amp;rsquo;ve fortunately not lost much motivation as to moving towards 0.02 and the added features which that will bring along with it.
A lot of this information exists online, but this post is meant to be a sort of introduction &amp;amp; combination of a few different sources. Just as a preface, this is meant for code hardening with clang &amp;amp; gcc.</description>

      <description>So this might be a little bit late, but here it is anyway. I finished editing most of the videos from Handmade Seattle 2019.
 There’s a whole playlist, but I won’t really bother putting it in here. I feel it’s probably pretty visible in the video description &amp;amp; ending.
Either way, let me know what you think about the editing! It’s been a few years since I’ve edited down a video of this size, usually I just make shorter meme videos.</description>

      <description>One day I’m going to die. This is a universal truth for each and every one of us. The last few weeks before writing this have been rough for me. That’s why I’m writing this, as a message to my future self to recognize where I was and where I’ve gotten to. I encourage everyone to write a bucket list of their own.
Here are the current goals of mine, I won’t remove any, but I will add some if I start to run low.</description>

      <title>pi zero: game console</title>

      <description>The above picture is the Raspberry Pi Zero W (Same size as the non-wireless) next to a standard US Quarter.
The following has been a side project of mine for a few months now. Mostly sitting idle while I do research on breaks.
Often times when people are told that someone is making a raspberry pi game console they think one of two things: Someone is building an emulation / retropie machine, or they don’t know what they’re talking about.</description>

      <title>beyond the void: a brief history</title>

      <description>Beyond the Void is a dungeon crawler. It has randomly generated dungeons. You can play solo or online. In multiplayer you have 2 main options: You can crawl the dungeon with friends, or control the dungeon to stop them. If you haven’t played the demo already, I suggest you try it out. The demo is free and will always be free.
I’ve been working on the game in conceptual form for over 3 1/2 years now.</description>
