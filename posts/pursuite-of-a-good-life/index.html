			<p>My brain likes to optimize things.
It&rsquo;s actually pretty good at it, unfortunately.</p>
<p>As a result, I spend a lot of time attempting to optimize my life. But you can only do so much. You can eat well, exercise, get proper rest, the list goes on. The struggle of existence is that it&rsquo;s in flux at all times. One cannot effectively program their life, and expect it to stay that way forever. If you&rsquo;ve read my previous posts, you might be aware that this theme is central to everything I write. It&rsquo;s deliberate.</p>
<p>It all comes back to the phrase &ldquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&rdquo;. Which are considered in the American ethos to be &ldquo;unalienable rights&rdquo;. The thing that took me until recent to fully understand is, while those are core values in American society, life and liberty are given. But happiness has to be pursued. I, like many, don&rsquo;t often just <em>exist</em> as <em>happy</em>. You can jump on the hedonic treadmill and run after it as much as you want. Much of our lives are considered a pursuit, right? You&rsquo;re looking for a better job, maybe you&rsquo;re aiming to buy a house, whatever it may be, it&rsquo;s always <em>goals</em> in the abstract. Once that goal is reached, it&rsquo;s onto the next one.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been rereading <strong>Waking Up by Sam Harris</strong>. In the latter half there&rsquo;s a rather nonchalant quote which stood out to me,&ldquo;We need not reach the end of the path to enjoy the benefits of walking it&rdquo;. He summarizes the point of this writing better than I could. My point is, it&rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in long term, big picture, goals. But life isn&rsquo;t about getting that promotion, or making X dollars in a year. I&rsquo;m not suggesting we should shave our heads and move to India. But in recent months, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate that, in simple terms, I&rsquo;m still alive. Maybe that&rsquo;s all I really need.</p>
