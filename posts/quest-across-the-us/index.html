			<p>Hey</p>
<p>In the last few years, I&rsquo;ve been sort of entranced with the idea of road-tripping across the US from one coast to the next. It&rsquo;s even on my <a href="https://tek256.com/posts/my-bucket-list/">bucket list</a>. Another part of this trip is that I&rsquo;ve been working on film &amp; keeping up with making a documentary throughout the whole process of making my game Lost Souls. I&rsquo;ll be doing my best to document what I can with what I have. I&rsquo;m taking <a href="https://streamlabs.com/tek256">donations</a> to possibly help make the trip a little more comfortable or to document better with a proper action camera like a GoPro. Basically something that isn&rsquo;t the somewhat unwieldy DSLR setup that I have. Either way, if you&rsquo;re in between any of these stops, let me know! I&rsquo;m always interested in meeting new people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on taking this trip by the end of September / early October. Hopefully being back in Seattle by November, circumstances permitting. If we happen to be in the 2nd or 3rd wave of the pandemic then I&rsquo;ll postpone it for the Spring of 2021, but I&rsquo;d definitely prefer to do it this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be driving during the day, and programming at night. Using the little ThinkPad T460s I have. Leading up to this I&rsquo;m actually going through the process of selling just about everything I own. I&rsquo;ll be buying some beater I can wrench on myself that has abundant parts. A lot of this trip will be an adventure for me, but it&rsquo;s also about finding someplace to call home. I&rsquo;ve never felt very attached to where I am in the world in the Pacific Northwest. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like home anymore.</p>
<p>Sappy shit aside, here&rsquo;s the route I&rsquo;m planning on taking:</p>
<ul>
<li>South to Portland, probably spend a night there, meet up with some friends there</li>
<li>South again through Gold Beach, OR to San Francisco / Bay Area to meet up with other friends</li>
<li>Maybe South to LA</li>
<li>East Across the mountains possibly Las Vegas (if LA route)</li>
<li>To Atlanta, GA &amp; Savannah area</li>
<li>North West back to Tennessee</li>
<li>Stopping in Richmond, KY</li>
<li>Northwest to Sioux Falls, SD</li>
<li>West back through SD, WY, MT, ID to Seattle</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a long trip, I&rsquo;m planning on giving myself 3 to 4 weeks to do it all. Throughout all of it, I&rsquo;ll be sleeping in the back of whatever car I get. Google Maps clocks it at around 7k miles. This will be part of the documentary/short film I&rsquo;m making about the development of Lost Souls over the past year, year and a half.</p>
<p>So are you between one of these stops? You can tweet at me and let me know. I&rsquo;ll be tweeting out when I&rsquo;ll roughly arrive at each city.</p>
