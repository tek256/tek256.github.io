			<p>Distractions are everywhere. As the years roll on, more and more effective distractions are created. They seem to be so wide reaching that being distracted is now considered a norm.
Even hearing that someone is actively doing <em>nothing</em> is considered abnormal now. Boredom is often considered painful (not that it can&rsquo;t be). But what seems to be a worse fate is doom scrolling and still bored. I see it all the time in myself and those around me. The &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to do, so I&rsquo;ll just check twitter/reddit/youtube/email/app of your choice here&rdquo;.
I do this constantly, even in times of self imposed restriction, I&rsquo;ll often just substitute it with other things. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve opened GitHub for no good reason. There are a lot of parallels between weight loss and trying to become untangled from this web of distractions. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s one part self discipline and three parts environment. If you&rsquo;re trying to loose weight, generally you don&rsquo;t <em>buy</em> junk food, and you try not to go to the grocery store hungry either. It makes eating healthier the easiest option.<br>
It&rsquo;s a similar thought process with the newer age apps. Feeling depressed? Why not chat up a friend on Discord! Want to see some cats? Here are all the cats in the world all at once. Hungry? Just order your hunger away with a swipe of an app and an additional fee.
As some of you might have come to notice in my writings here, I try to pose questions for you to reflect on. And by asking the following, I&rsquo;m not suggesting we become a new age techno amish. But what level of convience is worth our free decision? I&rsquo;m not attempting to suggest that someone has a gun to your head telling you to,&ldquo;ORDER THE FUCKING FOOD NOW OR ITS A BULLET IN YOUR BRAIN&rdquo;. Now that could be an interesting screen play, but I don&rsquo;t think these things work like that. In a roundabout way we are influenced to keep returning to the apps for the instant gratification. You&rsquo;ll see the argument <strong>everywhere</strong> that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;the same biologically as we were 100,000 years ago with new technology that&rsquo;s smarter than our subconscious&rdquo; or some deviation of that. It&rsquo;s not wrong, it just feels like it&rsquo;s subverting the core problem: what we allow into our lives. If someone said,&ldquo;hey come try this meth it&rsquo;ll help you work longer!&rdquo; to you in 1938, you might not know that it could really fuck you up long term.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of related movements to attempt to &ldquo;end&rdquo; distraction, which however nice it sounds seems to always end up closer to a cult style following. Reading related books (titles omitted as to not be rude) seems to suggest that they are an almost &ldquo;elitest&rdquo; class, something that, honestly, only people in good positions can only afford to &ldquo;try out&rdquo;. Which gives it a feeling of &ldquo;exclusivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;speciality&rdquo; I think it doesn&rsquo;t deserve. I think the trick is to find the balance of things that allows you to optimally create, without having to release attention on a regular basis.</p>
<p>With that said, I always have a drive to <em>make</em> more, but I&rsquo;m still deciding on which mediums to present the creations. I think I&rsquo;ll make a two way newsletter of sorts, where we can have a more bidirectional conversation. As an added benefit I can send out creations without having to post it to social media and the likes.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call this non-movement techno-atheism. Get it?<br>
See ya later.</p>
