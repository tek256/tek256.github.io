			<p>How much of life do you actually remember? Which of these things do you remember? It&rsquo;s an interesting concept that these memories are self history hosted within our own brains. Often they&rsquo;re just not immediately accessible. If you think hard enough, what was it like when you were 3? How did you feel when you went to the first day of kindergarten? It&rsquo;s all there, sometimes it just takes more time to retrieve.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something to think about: I&rsquo;m not actually writing this now, when you&rsquo;re reading this. How much offset is there from me writing this to you reading it and understanding these words? This isn&rsquo;t the same experience I&rsquo;m having to what you&rsquo;re having at the exact moment of reading these words. But we&rsquo;re both still experiencing it. I might be dead right now, and you&rsquo;re still experiencing this.</p>
<p>With this, writing, I suppose is the best word for it, I&rsquo;m trying to ask a few questions. Firstly, what is actually worth remembering? And as a consequence, how do we prioritize our actions to coincide with that. Secondly, is it worth being remembered? I&rsquo;ve struggled with this question for quite some time. I remember being told I had a few weeks to live in my teens. As a result I wondered if I was going to be remembered by anyone outside of my immediate family. What did it matter? I&rsquo;m glad to point out that there is a sort of self evident hypocrisy with me posting this thought piece publicly. But my main question for consideration here is: at what point do we abandon idealistic pursuit of otherwise vague and intangible goals, and allow ourselves room to exist just as a simple human being? By existing as a simple human being I mean not counting the clock or mindlessly procrastinating. But existing outside of social obligations and habits, like a kid again.</p>
<p>What do you think? Where do you fall on this topic? I can&rsquo;t help but think that at the end of the day, what matters is having lived your life for yourself and to invest in those around you which will invest in you back. We don&rsquo;t know where, or when we will die. But I try to live in a way which I wouldn&rsquo;t regret not having done something. I suppose by in part of both prioritization and reasonable spontaneity. What are your priorities in life?</p>
